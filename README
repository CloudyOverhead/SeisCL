SeisCL is a program to perform (visco)elastic full waveform inversion in 3D and 2D (SV and SH).
As input, it takes model parameters and recorded data.
It can ouput modelled seismograms, a video of particule velocities, and the gradient for different parametrizations.

To compile the program, do:

cd ./SeisCL_MPI_3D/
make all
